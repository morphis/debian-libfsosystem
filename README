libfsosystem is a glib-2.0-based library for low level
system-related utilities.

It is written in Vala and compiles to C.

While being used primarily for the freesmartphone.org project,
it is versatile enough to be of use for many 3rd party projects.

If you feel there is something missing or want to report a bug,
